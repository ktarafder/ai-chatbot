Tips for Outreach via Linkedin, Cold email, & cold calling:
* The optimal word count for a successful cold email and LinkedIn outreach message typically falls within the range of 150 to 250 words. This length allows you to convey your message clearly, provide relevant information, and generate interest without overwhelming the recipient. Keeping your message concise and to the point increases the likelihood of it being read and understood, especially considering the busy schedules of professionals who receive numerous emails and messages daily.




* Green check linkedin messages, emails, and/or cold calls that you have done!
